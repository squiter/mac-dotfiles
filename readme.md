# Squiter's OSX dotfiles

Just clone this repo, move yourself to it and run:

```
./setup.sh
```

## Additional configs that I failed to automate

### iTerm2

Open iTerm2, navigate to General->Settings and point the settings directory to: `~/iterm2`. **Do not copy current configurations after doing that, it'll erase your saved ones!**.

### Raycast

Go to settings->advanced and import the settings saved on `~/raycast`
